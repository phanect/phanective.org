                We also intended to gather activity data of sex workers and sex industry companies to provide feedback to career support division.
              </p>

              <p>As a full stack engineer, I worked for backend, frontend, and infrastructure.</p>

              <p>While I'm in thie project, I have contributed several open source projects including Geddy and Sequelize.</p>

              <p>
                In this project, I have collaborated with engineers at Myanmar branch. We communicate in English, mainly on Slack and sometimes on Skype call.
              </p>

              <p>I used following technologies:<p>

              <h6>Backend</h6>

                A kind of CRM for a sex industry company.<br>
                Maintained and developed new functions for a web site manager.
                I mainly worked for backend and frontend.
              </p>
              <p>
                I implement it with SPA style architecture. Designed REST API with Slim framework and load them on frontend with Vue &amp; Polymer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The web manager has ton of technical debt. I'm fixing problems as follows, while I'm developing new functions:
                <ul>
                  <li>There were no automated test code. I'm creating tests.</li>
                  <li>
                    Almost the same systems are deployed for 10+ environments, but they are slightly different each other. I'm merging them to one code base.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Similar code in several pages. I'm putting together to one function (PHP/JS code) and Polymer Elements (code including HTML)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    View and logic are highly coupled and inefficiently working with designers. I'm separating them to REST API server and polymer-based template.
